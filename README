Mandatory 5 for subject INF1010, University of Oslo, spring 2013:
Brute-force Sudoku solving application with GUI.

Properties of this particular solution:
Large - the solver initially sets up required data structures sacrificing memory for efficient runtime.
No recursive method invocations - All recursion is unwound into one single method body that does the whole job without recursively invoking itself.
Primitive data types - Used to simplify code, allow for least common denominator object access.

The assignment deals with solving a Sudoku board that is loaded from a file. It applies a "brute-force" solving algorithm that records solutions (up to 500 most recent ones), and finally presents the user with an interface to view the board and the solutions, or dumping output to console, depending on command line arguments.
